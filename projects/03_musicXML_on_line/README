Due to browser security restrictions preventing the web application from opening network connections to domains other than the one your application came from (cross-domain networking), the following is necessary:

1. install webserver (apache) with PHP support
2. install PHP CURL module
3. create folder WEBROOT/in4331/
4. make symlink WEBROOT/in4331/01/ to target folder "01_getting_started"

Also, you have to make sure that your eXist server works at port 8899. Otherwise, fix the port value at proxy.php to make proxying work.
