Due to browser security restrictions preventing the web application from opening network connections to domains other than the one your application came from (cross-domain networking), the following is neccesarry:

1. install webserver (appache) with PHP support
2. install PHP CURL module
3. create folder WEBROOT/in4331/
4. make symlink to WEBROOT/in4331/01/ to target folder 01_getting_started
