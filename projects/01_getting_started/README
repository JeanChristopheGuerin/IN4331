To opent the application at your local machine, perform the following steps.

Due to browser security restrictions preventing the web application from opening network connections to domains other than the one your application came from (cross-domain networking), the following is necessary:

1. Install Apache web server with PHP support.
2. Install PHP CURL module.
3. Create folder WEBROOT/in4331/
4. Make symlink WEBROOT/in4331/01/ to target folder "01_getting_started".
5. Install eXist and start it, make sure that your eXist server works at port 8899. Otherwise, fix the port value at proxy.php to make proxying work.
6. Create a collection 'movies' and upload the files from datasets/movies there.
7. Start Apache and go to http://in4331/01/index.htm in your browser.
